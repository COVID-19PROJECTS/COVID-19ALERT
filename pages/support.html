        To prevent the spread of COVID-19: • Clean your hands often. Use soap
        and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub. • Maintain a safe distance from
        anyone who is coughing or sneezing. • Wear a mask when physical
        distancing is not possible. • Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth. •
        Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you
        cough or sneeze. • Stay home if you feel unwell. • If you have a fever,
        cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention. Calling in
        advance allows your healthcare provider to quickly direct you to the
        right health facility. This protects you, and prevents the spread of
        viruses and other infections. Masks Masks can help prevent the spread of
        the virus from the person wearing the mask to others. Masks alone do not
        protect against COVID-19, and should be combined with physical
        distancing and hand hygiene. Follow the advice provided by your local
        health authority.
